# The_Simon_Game
Simon is a classic electronic memory game where players are challenged to remember and repeat a sequence of coloured lights and sounds. The game consists of four coloured buttons, each corresponding to a different tone and colour.  The goal is to see how long you can remember and repeat the increasingly complex patterns correctly.
